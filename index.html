                      Trump ran in the California and Michigan primaries for nomination as the Reform Party candidate
                      for the 2000 presidential election but withdrew from the race in February 2000. A July 1999 poll
                      matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al
                      Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.

                    <p>
                      Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his
                      first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011
                      and giving speeches in early primary states. In May 2011 he announced he would not run and he
                      endorsed Mitt Romney in February 2012. Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken
                      seriously at the time.

                      On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. His campaign
                      was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion
                      polls. On Super Tuesday, Trump received the most votes, and he remained the front-runner
                      throughout the primaries. After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016 – which prompted the
                      remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns – RNC
                      chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.

                      Trump and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates Trump's refusal to say whether he would
                      accept the result of the election drew attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.

                    <p>
                      Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his
                      first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of
                      repealing the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
                      negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, authorizing the Keystone XL and Dakota
                      Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and
                      design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump's proposed immigration
                      policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a
                      wall on the Mexico–United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay
                      for it. He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States, and
                      criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing "anchor babies." As president, he frequently
                      described illegal immigration as an "invasion" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang
                      MS-13, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born
                      Americans. From 2018 onwards, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.–Mexico border, to
                      stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum, and from 2020 used the public charge
                      rule to restrict immigrants using government benefits from getting permanent residency via green
                      cards. Trump has reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump
                      took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and
                      15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year. Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration
                      caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees
                      accepted compared to the allowed limits. Trump described himself as a "nationalist" and his
                      foreign policy as "America First." He espoused isolationist, non-interventionist, and
                      protectionist views. His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of populist,
                      neo-nationalist and authoritarian governments. Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's
                      tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty, a lack of a consistent foreign policy, and
                      strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies. Trump
                      questioned the need for NATO, criticized the U.S.'s NATO allies, and privately suggested on
                      multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from the alliance.
